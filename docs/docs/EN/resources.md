To save lives from the plague, one must have the capacity to foresee and to forestall. Yet tracking the current situation has been notoriously difficult.
Based on our experience in studying China outbreak, there are several basic data sets required to fit the macro puzzle together, which are

- Number of patients (tested ill, recover, death) to deduce the constant in the basic epidemic model.
- Detailed patient travel information to reproduce the transmission process.
- The network of social connections to address the likelihood of transmission. (e.g. in a global level, an economic dependence index could be used to address the connection between countries)
- Time and quality of social-distancing control.
- The available number of testing and the nature of testing.
- Availability of hospital resources.
- All variables that can address the demography or level of public governance.

Those datasets are not available for all localities, and many of them don't have quality control or have a vague definition thus make it impossible to make a cross-border comparison.
It's worth noticing that even between OECD countries, the level of information disclosure between countries varies. Not to mention other countries that has more diverged economic or social differences.

However, some crowd-sourcing/self-organizing research groups has managed to form some of the datasets in several places. Including the famous [covid-tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/) and [JHU dashboard](http://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html) in the US.

Here we present some datasets available for research. Though many of them are not our best recommendation but are best in the public space.
We hope to work under the licence that anyone working with the facilitate of this project agrees to public his/her own data.
