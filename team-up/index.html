<h1 id="call-for-team-up">Call for team up<a class="headerlink" href="#call-for-team-up" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>We are building an open data website for epidemic research with the name of the Glacier Ice Project. We hope to have collaborative and talented developers and scientists to join us . The current state of the project and the team will be explained in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are<a class="headerlink" href="#who-we-are" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We are a group of volunteer data scientists and software/data engineers from the open source community. We have been working together on some small projects, which could potentially foster research on the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and help people all over the world fight against the virus and the possible secondary disasters, for more than a month. Members on the team have expertise including but not limited to: Physics, Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, Computational Biology and Computer Science. </p>
<h2 id="what-we-do">What we do<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-do" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One of our main goals is to enable anyone who’s willing to share reliable data points or has data-related skills to stay updated and contribute to fighting against the virus, rather than getting panic and worrying alone. </p>
<p>As the world becomes a complex system during the past few decades under globalization and urbanization, the Lancet and Nature call for cooperation for effective epidemic response, to combine all fields of knowledge and skills from all over the world. See here also.</p>
<p>But the reality is, it always takes time for the best researchers in each individual field to digest the knowledge of epidemiology and to get detailed data for downstream and detailed analysis. Many would fail, others may respond with a significant latency thus won’t have too much values in terms of timeliness.</p>
<p>We come up with this idea of helping each other to find the necessary information/data of research, and help climb the first few steps of staircases of research. Some of our team members finished writing an epidemic modeling 101 course, others have done boilerplate code for epidemic models. We are also setting up an API server for providing outbreak related info and epidemic data e. Discussion boards members’ research scope, help us to easily exchange information and data resources.</p>
<p>In summary, we are trying to do research while contributing to the larger community with our knowledge and love, this has been proven as one of the most efficient ways in modern data science problems by other communities like Kaggle.</p>
<p>e.g. this is a lab project from one of our team members recently, a Platform by Tokyo University and SUST that simulates the epidemic exposure process in the city, which covers previous lack of research in the measurement of epidemic control in micro-levels.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to do, but one could never do it alone, and it’s never too late to start.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-met">How we met<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-met" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We are volunteers from the Wuhan2020 community. The community is the largest open source community during epidemic outbreaks. It attracts more than 3,000 people in the first three days.</p>
<p>The community project itself is a craigslist of hospitals and logistics services. However, our data science team consists of independent researchers, has its own mission, thus does not receive any financial or technical support directly from the community project.</p>
<p>As the corvarious now becomes a global health emergency, we decide to utilize our experience of research cooperation, to launch a project focusing on open data and open research, not only to help the epidemic research but also for social sciences and other fields.</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-the-project">Current state of the project<a class="headerlink" href="#current-state-of-the-project" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>API service:</strong> The tech stack is PostgreSQL+Python+OpenAPI(Swagger), the API server is publicly available here: https://www.sturgeons.app/, while the codebase is still private, we are working hard to open-source it soon. We are using Swagger to build our data-APIs. The API-repo is private but we will make it open-source lately.</p>
<p><strong>Data(set):</strong> We have data of China which covers almost all the data in the public field, we are building our database of patients' information too. International data is our next step. We put most of our time on it because of the shortage of manpower.</p>
<p><strong>Modeling:</strong> Our modeling repo on Github has received 100+ stars without any public exposure or advertising besides  the project Github page itself. We are thinking about moving it to a standalone repo to avoid confusion with the main craigslist project.</p>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> Currently all users are on GitHub users thus narrowed its audience. We are working on a website to address this. So a website demo is under construction. I wrote the draft of our website with Figma. Data visualizations will be part of the website and we need will help on it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> We have received emails asking about using our data from the Github page. Our active contributors are the sample of core users of our projects. All data scientists and quantitative researchers are potential users/consumers, which is quite a large group. Based on current statistics, 1/10 of them may join the discussion and 1/50 could theoretically become active contributors.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact<a class="headerlink" href="#contact" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You may contact me by sending emails to <em>stockard.h[AT]gmail[DOT]com</em>.
Apology for my lack of leisure time so I don’t like emails back-and-forth. If you’ve read everything I wrote here and you are truly interested, I believe we could have a pleasant conversation about what we can bring to each other.
It will be a highly technical and data-driven project. We are cordially looking forward to having you on the team.</p></div>
